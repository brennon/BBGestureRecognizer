/**
Delegates of a gesture recognizer--that is, an instance of a subclass of
`BBUIGestureRecognizer`--adopt the UIGestureRecognizerDelegate protocol to
fine-tune an appâ€™s gesture-recognition behavior. The delegates receive
messages from a gesture recognizer, and their responses to these messages
enable them to affect the operation of the gesture recognizer or to specify
a relationship between it and another gesture recognizer, such as allowing
simultaneous recognition or setting up a failure requirement.

    recognizing its gesture. Note that returning `true` is guaranteed to
