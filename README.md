# BBGestureRecognizer

BBGestureRecognizer is a port of UIGestureRecognizer for use with SpriteKit. SpriteKit does not allow you to attach a UIGestureRecognizer to an SKNode. Instead, a BBGestureRecognizer can be attached to an SKNode and will behave similarly, allowing you to encapsulate handling of gesture recognition on SKNodes in gesture recognizers. Basic support for failure dependencies between BBGestureRecognizers is included. See the docs for more information.

The current state of the project if very much alpha (I will break you), but certainly usable and useful. Please feel free to send your suggestions or pull requests.
